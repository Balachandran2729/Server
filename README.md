# SERVER

This project provides a simple API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** (via **Mongoose**) that allows users to store and manage their usernames and passwords. It demonstrates basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it a great learning resource and easily extendable for larger applications.

## üöÄ Features
* Store and manage usernames and passwords.
* CRUD operations with MongoDB.
* RESTful API design.
* Environment variable management with **dotenv**.
* Auto-reload during development with **Nodemon**.
